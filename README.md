# IWRasterizer
Summer 2024 Project consisting of a 3D rasterizer implemented with JavaScript and HTML.

This project is a work in progress.

Large inspiration was taken from Kristoffer Dyrkorn's article on rasterization along with Scratchapixel's articles particularly on the converstions between world, camera, and raster space.

Using the program:
Functionality is currently limited. The example pyramid is hardcoded into the website as an array of specific vectors.
The pyramid can be clicked, dragged, and thrown left or right using a mouse, and will accelerate slowly back to it's default rotational speed.

Planned functionality:
Movable light source
Zoom in and out with scroll
Fully controllable camera
Swap between shapes with more polygons
